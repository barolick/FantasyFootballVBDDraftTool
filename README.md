# FantasyFootballVBDDraftTool
FantasyFootballVBDDraftTool is a tool intended to be used alongside your live fantasy football drafts. The tool scrapes projected player statistics from fantasypros.com and then processes that data applying the value based drafting algorithm. The tool allows you to identify the best players still available in your draft based on the value based drafting philosophy explained here: https://www.footballguys.com/05vbdrevisited.htm.
## Recent improvements
The code was recently ported to a maven project to improve dependency management and maintainability. Besides that, not much has been changed since the tool was originally developed in 2018. 
## How to run
After cloning the code to a local repository, the tool can be used by running "mvn javafx:run" in the terminal.
